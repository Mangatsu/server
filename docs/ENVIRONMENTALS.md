_~~Struck out~~ values have no effect yet._

- ~~**MTSU_LOG_LEVEL**~~=info
  - Log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace
- **MTSU_INITIAL_ADMIN_NAME**=admin
- **MTSU_INITIAL_ADMIN_PW**=admin321
    - Credentials for the initial admin user. Recommended to change.
- **MTSU_HOSTNAME**=localhost
- **MTSU_PORT**=5050

- **MTSU_BASE_PATHS**=freeform1;/home/user/doujinshi;;structured2:/home/user/manga
    - Paths to the archive directories. Relative or absolute paths are accepted.
    - First specify the type of the directory and a numerical ID (e.g. freeform1 or structured2) and then the path separated by a semicolon: `;`.
    - Multiple paths can be separated by a double-semicolon: `;;`.
    - Format: `<freeform|structured><ID>;<INTERNAL_PATH>;;<freeform|structured><ID>;<INTERNAL_PATH>`...
    - If using Docker Compose, make sure that the paths match the containerpaths in the volumes section.
- **MTSU_DATA_PATH**=../data
    - Location of the data dir which includes the SQLite db and the cache for gallery images and thumbnails. Relative or absolute paths are accepted.
    - Doesn't need changing if using Docker Compose.
- **MTSU_DISABLE_CACHE_SERVER**=false

- ~~**MTSU_CACHE_SIZE**~~=10000
  - Max size of the cache where galleries are extracted from the library in MB. Can overflow a bit especially if set too low.
- ~~**MTSU_CACHE_TTL**~~=604800
  - Time to live for the cache in seconds (604800 = 1 week).
- **MTSU_VISIBILITY**=public
    - **public**: anyone can access the collection and its galleries.
    - **restricted**: users need a global passphrase to access collection and its galleries.
    - **private**: only logged-in users can access the collection and its galleries.
    - In all modes, user accounts are supported and have more privileges than anonymous users (e.g. favorite galleries).

    - Passphrase to access the collection and its galleries.
    - Only used when **VISIBILITY** is set to **restricted**.
